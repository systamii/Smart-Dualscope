# Smart-Dualscope
By: Jasper Anderson, John Chandler, Hailee Gooden, Irene Hong, Ryan Thrasher


This project pertains to the design of a low-cost smart telescope suited for high-level Astrophotography. This repository specifically includes our calibration and astronomical object-tracking algorithms. Please stay tuned if you would like to see a optical (and perhaps even radio) telescope which is accessible and affordable for civilian scientists.
